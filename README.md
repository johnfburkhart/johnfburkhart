## Past Projects and Research
- [Implemented image preprocessing, transfer learning, and segmentation to classify and detect brain tumors from MRI data set](https://github.com/johnfburkhart/brain-tumor-classification-segmentation)
- [Used Bayesian statistical software and pathogen genome data to track the spread of pathogens carrying Lyme Disease](https://github.com/johnfburkhart/molecular-epidemiology-project)
- [Developer of NIH-funded Epidemiological modeling software](https://jrmihalj.github.io/nih-grant/)
- Studied the enumerative combinatorics of a genome inversion model (signed permutations under the actions of reversal) and managed to prove many new results. Publication is [in preparation](https://danaernst.com/scholarship/academic-writing/)
- [Aggregated, cleaned, and implemented predictive models on a biological dataset of multiplex polymerase chain reaction trials.](https://github.com/johnfburkhart/ML-Algorithms-for-mPCR-Design)
